# CODE
This is just some of the programming I have done through my college career. 

I am currently a Junior at Santa Clara University studying Computer Engineering. This is just some of my code that I wanted to share with the world. 

Hopefully it helps some of you out. The seconday purpose is to give people a glimpse into my coding style and hopefully shed some light on my patterns.
